Throughout this site, and in _Working in Cybersecurity_, I use the term "cybersecurity" as an umbrella that covers computer security, information security, information assurance, encryption, etc., etc. Not because I don't know or appreciate the history of the term "cyber," but because one of the goals of this project is to make the subject matter more accessible.

For that same reason you'll find me using the word "hacker" to mean both those who have carried out malicious, often criminal actions online, as well as in the more historically accurate sense. Context should make my intent clear.

For these, and any other vocabulary violations you feel compelled to point out, let me just reiterate that I want more than just insiders to know and appreciate what we do. I think that is more likely to happen if we avoid being too pedantic.
