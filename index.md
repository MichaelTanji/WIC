## Welcome to the Working in Cybersecurity Project

What’s it really like working in cybersecurity? Do I need a degree? Do I need to build a lab in my basement? Should I get certified? What was it like working with some of the pioneers in the field? Is this field really a meritocracy, or a toxic swamp of bro-fessionals perpetrating bad behavior? 

These and many other questions are hotly debated online, at conferences, and wherever hackers, engineers, and policy wonks gather to talk shop. _Working in Cybersecurity_ is a riff on the classic [_Working_](https://amzn.to/2MmWVXS) by Studs Terkel, an oral history of the myriad jobs that existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as told to Terkel by those who did them.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MichaelTanji/WIC/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
