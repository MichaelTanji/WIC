## Welcome to the Working in Cybersecurity Project

What’s it really like working in cybersecurity? Do I need a degree? Do I need to build a lab in my basement? Should I get certified? What was it like working with some of the pioneers in the field? Is this field really a meritocracy, or a toxic swamp of bro-fessionals perpetrating bad behavior? 

These and many other questions are hotly debated online, at conferences, and wherever hackers, engineers, and policy wonks gather to talk shop. _Working in Cybersecurity_ is a riff on the classic [_Working_](https://amzn.to/2MmWVXS) by Studs Terkel, an oral history of the myriad jobs that existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as told to Terkel by those who did them.
