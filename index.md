## Welcome to the Working in Cybersecurity Project

Whatâ€™s it really like working in cybersecurity? Do I need a degree? Do I need to build a lab in my basement? Should I get certified? What was it like working with some of the pioneers in the field? Is this field really a meritocracy, or a toxic swamp of bro-fessionals perpetrating bad behavior? 

These and many other questions are hotly debated online, at conferences, and wherever hackers, engineers, and policy wonks gather to talk shop. *[Working in Cybersecurity](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Cybersecurity-C-suite-everywhere-between/dp/1725877759)* was inspired by the classic [_Working_](https://amzn.to/2MmWVXS) by Studs Terkel: an oral history of the myriad jobs people did decades ago, as told to Terkel by those who did those jobs. This project is an attempt to recreate that effort, with a focus on cybersecurity and the people who do the wide range of jobs that make up the field.

Cybersecurity is often derided as yet-another field filled with white men. While the shading might be fairly monochromatic, it is still quite diverse in a number of different ways. Sub-specialities, the path that practitioners take to get into the field, not to mention the hard-won attitudes and opinions those practitioners have about the problems we face, both pressing and pedestrian.

In *Working in Cybersecurity* you'll hear from C-level executives, people who live on the command line, and others who may not be technical, but play an important role in our ability to advance the cause nevertheless.
