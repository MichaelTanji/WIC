## Welcome to the Working in Cybersecurity Project

Whatâ€™s it really like working in cybersecurity? Do I need a degree? Do I need to build a lab in my basement? Should I get certified? What was it like working with some of the pioneers in the field? Is this field really a meritocracy, or a toxic swamp of bro-fessionals perpetrating bad behavior? 

These and many other questions are hotly debated online, at conferences, and wherever hackers, engineers, and policy wonks gather to talk shop. _Working in Cybersecurity_ is a riff on the classic [_Working_](https://amzn.to/2MmWVXS) by Studs Terkel, an oral history of the myriad jobs that existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as told to Terkel by those who did them.

### The Subjects

Cybersecurity (for the purposes of this work an umbrella term that encompases computer security, information security, information assurance, etc) is often derided as yet-another field filled with white men. While the shading might be fairly monochromatic, it is still quite diverse in a number of different ways. Sub-specialities, as noted above, the path that practitioners take to get into the field, not to mention the hard-won attitudes and opinions those practitioners have about the problems we face, both pressing and pedestrian.

In _Working in Cybersecurity_ you'll hear from C-level executives, people who live on the command line, and others who may not be technical, but play an important role in our ability to advance the cause nevertheless.
